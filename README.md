# Data-Structures-II Coursework
Habib University - Spring 2023

This repository contains coursework for the CS 201 Data Structures II course at Habib University. The assignments cover a range of data structures and algorithms, implemented in Python, and are organized by homework folders. Each assignment includes a LaTeX problem set, Python source code, and tests.

## Repository Structure

- `Homework0/` — OOP and Iterators in Python (practice, ungraded)
- `Homework1/` — Lists, image operations, and amortized analysis
- `Homework2/` — Skiplists and Dynamic List ADT
- `Homework3/` — Hash Tables and AVL Trees
- `Homework4/` — Information Retrieval (Trie and Inverted Index)

Each homework folder typically contains:
- `hwX.tex` — Assignment prompt (LaTeX)
- `src/` — Python source code for the assignment
- `test_*.py` — Unit tests (use `pytest`)
- `images/`, `data/`, or `masks/` — Supporting files for assignments (where applicable)
- `README.md` — Assignment-specific instructions and background

## Assignment Overviews

### Homework 0: OOP and Iterators in Python
Practice assignment to familiarize students with the course structure, Python OOP, iterators, and `pytest`.

### Homework 1: Lists and Image Operations
Focuses on implementing a List ADT, using it for image operations, and understanding amortized analysis.

### Homework 2: Skiplists and Dynamic List ADT
Explores skiplists and dynamic lists through implementation and conceptual problems.

### Homework 3: Hash Tables and AVL Trees
Involves implementing hash tables and AVL trees, and understanding their operations and conflict resolution strategies.

### Homework 4: Information Retrieval
Centers on implementing trie and inverted index data structures for information retrieval tasks.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired homework folder.
3. Read the assignment `README.md` and `hwX.tex` for instructions.
4. Implement solutions in the `src/` directory.
5. Run tests using `pytest` (e.g., `pytest test_*.py`).
6. Compile LaTeX files for the written portion (if required).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pytest` for testing
- LaTeX for compiling problem sets
